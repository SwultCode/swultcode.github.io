## Welcome / First Introductions

Hi! Welcome to my blog! Let me give you a little insight on A: who I am, and B: what I do.

I'm Swult, or just Sam, a Math & Data Science Major living in Australia. I'm more commonly known online for my editing work, which is all compiled into one feed over on https://swult.net. I may go into details at some point on how that whole site works and my process in making it, but it's pretty stock standard.

This blog space is intended as a place adjacent to my work, a place for me to work on projects for publishing (and hopefully will encourage me to finish some things haha). I imagine that all sorts of posts will be made here, so I'm not going to fit it all into one umbrella, however if you're into ML, math, computer graphics, or art, I'm sure you'll find at least something here nice. As to when you can expect posts... IDK! Maybe at some point in the distant future one can dream of a more well rested and scheduled Swult, but, currently that's not me.
